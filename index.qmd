# Welcome to the Gapminder Data Analysis Website

The **Gapminder dataset** contains global economic and health indicators over time, including **life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita** for various countries and continents from 1952 to 2007.

## Navigation

- [Life V.S GDP](life-gdp.qmd)
- [Life V.S Population](life-population.qmd)
- [Country](country.qmd)

## About the Data

The dataset has been modified to:
- Rename `lifeExp` to **life_expectancy** and `gdpPercap` to **gdp_per_capita**.
- Convert population values to **millions** for better readability.
- Store the processed data in `gapminder.csv`.

Below is a preview of the first three rows of the dataset:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the modified dataset
gapminder_df = pd.read_csv("gapminder.csv")

# Display the first three rows
print(gapminder_df.head(3))
```
